# Explanation Problem 4

## Active Directory


I followed the hierarchy presented in the problem statement to create an Active Directory. I adopted
recursion, assuming a transitive relationship between directories, to solve the problem.

    Time Complexity

        Recursion - > O(n^2) Recursively calling fuction with inner for loop.

    Data Structures

        Class structure uses a list to store user and group names.
    
    Space Complexity

        Activity Directory has fixed side - O(N)
